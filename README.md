### Week 3 Skill Distillery Weekend Homework

#### Overview
This program is a functional command line blackjack game. The dealer and a player have a hand of cards. At first, both are dealt two cards. The total value of the cards should not pass twenty-one. If both the player and the dealer have a final score below twenty-one, whoever has the higher score wins. Cards between 2 and 10 have their numeric value, while jack, queen, and king have a value of 10. Ace has a value of 11 if the total score, including those 11, is under 21 and a value of 1 otherwise.
The player knows their cards and one of the dealer cards. They then decide if they want to get another card (hit) or let the dealer play. The dealer has a built-in logic that calls hit if the total value of cards is less than 17 and stays otherwise.
